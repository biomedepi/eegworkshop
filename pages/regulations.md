### **<span style="color:#2B547E">Scope</span>**
\
The EEG signal processing workshop aims to have contributions across multiple applications of EEG, such as BCI, seizure detection, sleep staging, and auditory attention decoding. The workshop will focus on the following subjects:

- Emerging fields of EEG processing (e.g. learning task-agnostic EEG representations, generalizability, explainability, uncertainty estimation).

- Special attention will go to methods that help to tackle the remaining challenges standing between the current automated EEG processing methods and clinical practice.

- Both traditional signal processing methods and deep learning approaches.
