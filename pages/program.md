### **<span style="color:#2B547E">Paper presentations</span>**

[//]: # A regular paper presentation session on EEG signal processing will be held. We are welcoming contributions, which should be submitted by February 24 via the main conference platform, and will be reviewed according to the conference standards ([scope]({{ '/scope/' | relative_url }}) and [call for papers]({{ '/call/' | relative_url }}) for more information). Upon acceptance, papers will be given the opportunity to present, and will be published at the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.
The following papers will be presented:
- *Decoding Auditory Attention from EEG Data using Cepstral Analysis*, Emina Alickovic (Eriksholm Research Centre); Carlos Fransico Mendoza (Eriksholm Research Centre); Andrew Segar (Eriksholm Research Centre); Maria Sandsten (Lund University); Martin A Skoglund (Linköping University)*

[//]: # ### **<span style="color:#2B547E">Panel debate</span>**  

[//]: # *"What are useful EEG representations, and what can EEG signal processing look like in the AI era?"*  

[//]: # We are gathering a renowned set of panel members, among which our invited speakers, to discuss one of the important future directions of EEG processing. We will ask our panel whether latest advances in AI (e.g., self-supervised learning) can help to achieve task-agnostic EEG representations. Furthermore, we will initiate a discussion on whether these unified representations can be used for knowledge discovery, by unraveling new information from the EEG.
