## **<span style="color:#2B547E">EEG signal processing for the future: integrating insights across domains</span>**

Welcome to the website of the special **<span style="color:#2B547E">electroencephalography (EEG) workshop</span>** at **ICASSP 2023 (4-9 June, Rhodes Island, Greece)**. This first edition of workshops at ICASSP is aimed at attracting and including a wider audience of both students and professionals and enriching the conference. In the EEG workshop, we (KU Leuven, Queen Mary University of London and Inria) are joining forces to bring together leading speakers in the fascinating field of EEG processing, and to create a meeting point at the crossroads between medicine and signal processing. In this workshop, we invite all ICASSP participants to get interested in brain signals. Topics of discussion will focus on recent advances and overarching challenges of the field.


[//]: <> By bringing more attention to this fascinating topic at ICASSP 2023, this workshop will drive new interest and momentum in the field of EEG signal processing.

**EEG** is important in the analysis of brain activity and brain disease, and is widely used for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, sleep scoring, emotion recognition and seizure detection. Many signal processing and machine learning methods have uncovered patterns and information from these complex signal. Deep learning techniques have managed to achieve close-to-human accuracy in many classification tasks, and have shown promise to discover new knowledge from EEG signals.

Unlike in the field of audio and speech processing, adoption of automated EEG processing systems is rather slow. EEG datasets are expensive to acquire and generalizing across datasets is hard due to differences in acquisition setups. To overcome these issues, we need adaptable AI systems that can learn from small amounts of data. Moreover, in high-stakes clinical applications, trust in AI systems through interpretations and uncertainty estimation is crucial. In this workshop, we aim to focus on ongoing research aimed at **addressing the challenges that stand between automated EEG processing methods and clinical practice**.
